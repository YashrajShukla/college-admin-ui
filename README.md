Please find attached my completed React assignment for the College Admin UI. I have developed the application using React, Material-UI, Formik, and Yup within the given time frame.

Key Features Implemented:

Add Courses with validation and local storage persistence

Add Students (First Name, Last Name, DOB, Photo upload/capture)

Assign Subjects to Students with form validation

Data is saved locally using localStorage and remains accessible across restarts

Forms include Clear options for better usability

Lists are styled with Material-UIâ€™s sx for a neat, modern look
